*rebuildd* is a build daemon to rebuild Debian packages.

# A bit of history
## Once upon a time

During the release cycle of
[the Debian 4.0 (etch) version](http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/), I
decided to rebuild several times the Debian archive on my idle sparc and
i386 boxes. The main goal of this action was to find
[FTBFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTBFS) bugs.

Currently, rebuilding the whole packages archive implies to set-up a
[buildd](http://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/), which is kind of complicated
stuff.

I already wrote up a bit of documentation about this process, but I was not
totaly convinced.

*buildd* was not made for what I wanted to do. The database is ugly, it's
old tech and it's Perl. Furthermore,
[sbuildd](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/sbuild), is easily
breakable by a *postinst* problem or whatever, leaving your chroot broken
and unusable. [schroot](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/schroot)
support has never really worked, and looking at the code (some months
before) about this feature, I think it was a

## First idea
My first idea was to rewrite some kind of buildd in a better way, I mean in
a way that works.

Rewriting the build process was not one of my goal, and I succeeded in that
by choosing
[pbuilder](http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/pbuilder.html) (or
cowbuilder, or whatever you want) to build things.

That gave me a better idea on what to focus on: the build management.

I chose to use [Python](http://www.python.org) as programming language,
mainly because I never heavily used it.


## Overview
Here is the diagram of what 5 days of coding gave, giving the first 0.1.0
release:

The main specifications of *rebuildd* is multi-threading, and probably, a
small design. Beware: I'm not a Python-guru yet, so some kind of stuff may
appear to be tricky or inefficient, mainly because I am not comfortable with
the language yet. However, I welcome patches. Lucky you. However becoming
with 0.2.0, things are better.

All data are stored in a SQL backend. You can use any SQL engine, I really
don't care, since all the job is not done by me. By default, *rebuildd* uses
*SQLite*, which may be a poor choice.


## Future
I think there's a lot of things to add, but it's functional for me right
now. I'd like to add Web 2.0 feature, like using AJAX to refresh build logs
in realtime on the webpage. That would be SO GREAT LOL.

# Download
## Packages
*rebuildd* is available in Debian.

 - [rebuildd packages](http://packages.debian.org/rebuildd)
 - [PTS page for rebuildd](http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/rebuildd.html)

## Git

The
[Git repository](http://git.debian.org/?p=rebuildd/rebuildd.git;a=summary)
is available on [Alioth](http://alioth.debian.org).

# How it works

Just install the Debian package. You will need at least Python 2.5,
[Webpy](http://www.webpy.org/) (python-webpy) and
[SQLObject](http://www.sqlobject.org/) (python-sqlobject).

I advise you to run *rebuildd* in a chroot (use *debootstrap* to create
one).

Then run it as root, so you will be able to use *pbuilder*. (If you don't want
to run it as root, you can use *sudo*, but you will run into trouble when
you'll want to cancel and halt build jobs)

A network server will be launched: a telnet server on port 9999.

Juste telnet to the first one, and enjoy. Here's an example session on what
you can do. Please remember to type *help* for getting help.

<pre>
% telnet localhost 9999
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connected on rebuildd on abydos.adm.naquadah.org
rebuildd@abydos-> status

rebuildd@abydos-> job add telak 0.5-1 sid
I: job added
rebuildd@abydos-> job reload
I: 1 new jobs added
rebuildd@abydos-> job start
I: 1 jobs started
rebuildd@abydos-> status
I: Job 100 for telak_0.5-1 is status BUILDING on sid/i386 for None
rebuildd@abydos-> job add telak 0.5-1 sid i386 acid@debian.org
I: job added
rebuildd@abydos-> job reload
I: 1 new jobs added
rebuildd@abydos-> status
I: Job 100 for telak_0.5-1 is status BUILDING on sid/i386 for None
I: Job 101 for telak_0.5-1 is status WAIT_LOCKED on sid/i386 for acid@debian.org
</pre>

Note that *rebuildd* will do a *job reload* by itself every *check_every* seconds.

You can check what's going on by opening the rebuildd log, located by
default on */var/log/rebuildd/rebuildd.log*.

You can also view builds status and logs in live by pointing your Web browser to port 9998 of your server.
This only works if you start rebuildd-httpd. You'll see something like that:

![rebuildd HTTP interface](/media/images/rebuildd/rebuildd_http.jpg)

There's also a command line tool which can manipulate database, called
rebuildd-job.
