It's been a while since I blogged about something. So here's a bunch of
things I've done the last month.

# Holidays

Well, I've been in holidays one week. :-P

# awesome

There have been a huge number of changes between 3.3 (released in June) and
3.4 (almost relesed). I wrote a small but very useful object layer on top of
Lua, which adds a class/object system a bit like
[gobject](http://www.gtk.org). I've also replaced all the hooks by
per-class/object signals. Finally, the awesome Lua basement are cleaner than
they were before, and the extendability is improved. How nice.

We're trying to release 3.4 (rc2 should be out soon), but the development
pace is a bit slower than a year before. We're basically almost 2 months
late on what was our previous release rate. Not a big deal however.

I've started working on 3.5 slowly. It gonna get amazing new features
too. :-)

# Google Summer Of Code 2009

I've mentored Mariusz Ceier on [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org) GSoC. He
worked on adding Xinput2 and XKB extensions. And he managed to do this. His
work should be imported ASAP, the discussion has started on XCB maling list
last week.

In exchange, Google offered me (and to every mentor) an awful blue t-shirt!
Thanks Google! :-P
