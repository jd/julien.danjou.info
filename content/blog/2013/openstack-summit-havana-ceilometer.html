Last week was the
[OpenStack Design Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/)
in Portland, OR where we, developers, discussed and designed the new
OpenStack release (Havana) coming up.

The summit has been wonderful. It was my first OpenStack design summit --
even more as a PTL -- and bumping into various people I've never met so far
and worked with online only was a real pleasure!

[Nick Barcet](http://nicolas.barcet.com/) from
[eNovance](http://www.enovance.com), our dear previous Ceilometer PTL, and
myself, talked about Ceilometer and presented the work that has been done
for Grizzly, with some previews of what we'll like to see done for its
Havana release. You can take a look at
[the slides](http://julien.danjou.info/media/Ceilometer%20presentation%20ODS%20Havana.pdf)
if you're curious.

# Design sessions

Ceilometer had his design sessions during the last days of the summit. We
noted a lot of things and commented during the sessions in our
[Etherpads instances](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Summit/Havana/Etherpads#Ceilometer).

The first session was a description of Ceilometer core architecture for
interested people, and was a wonderful success considering that the room was
packed. Our [Doug Hellmann](http://doughellmann.com/) did a wonderful job
introducing people to Ceilometer and answering question.

The next session was about getting feedbacks from our users. We had a lot of
surprise to discover wonderful real use-cases and deployments, like the CERN
using Ceilometer and generating 2 GB of data per day!

The following sessions ran on Thursday and were much more about new features
discussion. A lot ot already existing blueprints were discussed and quickly
validated during the first morning session. Then,
[Sandy Walsh](http://www.sandywalsh.com/) introduced the architecture they
use inside [StackTach](https://github.com/rackerlabs/stacktach), so we can
start thinking about getting things from it into Ceilometer.

API improvements were discussed without surprises and with a good consensus
on what needs to be done. The four following sessions that occupied a lot of
the days were related to alarming. All were lead by Eoghan Glynn, from
[RedHat](http://redhat.com), who did an amazing job presenting the possible
architectures with theirs pros and cons. Actually, all we had to do was to
nod to his designs and acknowledge the plan on how to build this.

That last two sessions were about discussing advanced models for billing
where we got some interesting feedback from Daniel Dyer from HP, and then
were a quick follow-up of the StackTach presentation from the morning
session.

# Havana roadmap

The
[list of blueprints targeting Havana is available](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/havana)
and should be finished by next week. If you want to propose blueprints,
you're free to do so and inform us about it so we can validate it. The same
applies if you wish to implement one of them!

## API extension

I do think the API version 2 is going to be heavily extended during this
release cycle. We need more feature, like the
[group-by](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/api-group-by)
functionality.

## Healthnmon

In parallel of the design sessions, discussions took place in the
unconference room with the Healthnmon developers to figure out a plan in
order to merge some of their efforts into Ceilometer. They should provide a
component to help Ceilometer supports more hypervisors than it currently
does.

## Alarming

Alarming is definitely going to be the next big project for Ceilometer.
Today, Eoghan and I started building blueprints on alarming,
[centralised in a general blueprint](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/alarming).

We know this is going to happen for real and very soon, thanks to the
engagements of [eNovance](http://enovance.com) and
[RedHat](http://redhat.com) who are committing resources to this amazing
project!
