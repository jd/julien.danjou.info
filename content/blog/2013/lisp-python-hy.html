{% mark excerpt %}

I've meant to look at [Hy](http://github.com/paultag/hy) since
[Paul Tagliamonte](http://http://blog.pault.ag/) started to talk to me about
it, but never took a chance until now.
Yesterday, Paul indicated it was a good time for me to start looking at it,
so I spent a few hours playing.

# But what's Hy?

Python is very nice: it has a great community and a wide range of useful
libraries. But let's face it, it misses a great language.

Hy is an implementation of a
[Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) on top of
Python.

Technically, Hy is built directly with a custom made parser (for now) which
then translates expressions using the
[Python AST](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html) module to generate
code, which is then run by Python. Therefore, it shares the same properties
as Python, and is a Lisp-1 (i.e. with a single namespace for symbols and
functions).

If you're interested to listen Paul talking about Hy during last PyCon US, I
recommend watching his lightning talk. As the name implies, it's only a few
minutes long.

# Does it work?

I've been cloning the code and played around a bit with Hy. And to my
greatest surprise and pleasure, it works quite well. You can imagine writing
Python from there easily. Part of the syntax smells like
[Clojure](http://clojure.org)'s, which looks like a good thing since they're
playing in the same area.

You can try a [Hy REPL](http://hy.pault.ag/) in your Web browser if you
want.

Here's what some code look like:

{% syntax clojure %}
(import requests)

(setv req (requests.get "http://hy.pault.ag"))
(if (= req.status_code 200)
  (for (kv (.iteritems req.headers))
    (print kv))
  (throw (Exception "Wrong status code")))
{% endsyntax %}

This code would ouput:

<pre>
('date', 'Wed, 03 Apr 2013 12:09:23 GMT')
('connection', 'keep-alive')
('content-encoding', 'gzip')
('transfer-encoding', 'chunked')
('content-type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
('server', 'nginx/1.2.6')
</pre>

As you can see, it's really simple to write Lispy code that really uses
Python idioms.

There's obviously still a lots of missing features in Hy. The language if
far from complete and many parts are moving, but it's really promising, and
Paul's doing a great job implementing every idea.

I actually started to hack a bit on Hy, and will try to continue to do so,
since I'm really eager to learn a bit more about both Lisp and Python
internals in the process. I've already send a few patches on small bugs I've
encountered, and proposed a few ideas. It's really exciting to be able to
influence early a language design that I'll love to use! Being a recent fan
of Common Lisp, I tend to grab the good stuff from it to add them into Hy.
