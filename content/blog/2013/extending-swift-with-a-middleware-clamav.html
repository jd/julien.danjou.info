In this article, I'm going to explain you how you can extend
[Swift](http://launchpad.net/swift), the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org)
Object Storage project, so it performs extra action on files at upload or at
download time.

{% endmark %}

We're going to build an anti-virus filter inside Swift. The goal is to
refuse uploaded data if they contain a virus. To help us with virus
analyses, we'll use [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net).

# WSGI, paste and middleware

<div class="span3 pull-right thumbnail">
    <img src="/media/images/lolcat-tube.jpg">
    <p>In a pipeline, a black cat can become a white cat with the help of
some middleware.</p>
</div>

To do our content analysis, the best place to hook in the Swift architecture
is at the beginning of every request, on **swift-proxy**, before the file is
actually stored on the cluster. Swift proxy uses, like many other OpenStack
projects, [paste](http://pythonpaste.org/) to build his HTTP architecture.

Paste uses WSGI and provides an architecture based on a pipeline. The
pipeline is composed of a succession of middleware, ending with one
application. Each middleware has the chance to look at the request or at the
response, can modify it, and then pass it to the following middleware. The
latest component of the pipeline is the real application, and in this case,
the Swift proxy server.

If you've already deployed Swift, you encountered a default pipeline in the
*swift-proxy.conf* configuration file:

{% syntax ini %}
[pipeline:main]
pipeline = catch_errors healthcheck cache ratelimit tempauth proxy-logging proxy-server
{% endsyntax %}

This is a really basic pipeline with a few middleware. The first one catches
error, the second one is in charge to return _200 OK_ response if you send a
_GET /healthcheck_ request on your proxy server. The third one is in charge
of caching, the fourth one is used for rate limiting, the fifth for
authentication, the sixth one for logging, and the final one is the actual
proxy server, in charge of proxying the request to the account, container,
or object servers (the others components of Swift). Of course, we could
remove or add any of the middleware here at our convenience.

Be aware that the order matters: for example, if you put _healthcheck_ after
_tempauth_, you won't be able to access the _/healthcheck_ URL without being
authenticated!


# ClamAV

<div class="pull-left">
    <img width="100" src="/media/images/clamav.png">
</div>

If you don't know [ClamAV](http://clamav.org), it's an antivirus engine
designed for detecting trojans, viruses, malware and other malicious
threats. Wwe're going to use it to scan every incoming file. To build the
middleware, we'll use the Python binding
[pyclamd](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/clamd). The API is quite simple, see:

{% syntax python %}
>>> import pyclamd
>>> pyclamd.init_unix_socket('/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl')
>>> print pyclamd.scan_stream(pyclamd.EICAR)
{'stream': 'Eicar-Test-Signature(44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f:68)'}
>>> print pyclamd.scan_stream("safe!")
None
{% endsyntax %}

# Anatomy of a WSGI middleware

Your WSGI middleware should consist of a callable object. Usually this is
done with a class implementing the *\_\_call__* method. Here's a basic
boilerplate:

{% syntax python %}
class SwiftClamavMiddleware(object):
    """Middleware doing virus scan for Swift."""

    def __init__(self, app, conf):
        # app is the final application
        self.app = app

    def __call__(self, env, start_response):
        return self.app(env, start_response)


def filter_factory(global_conf, **local_conf):
    conf = global_conf.copy()
    conf.update(local_conf)

    def clamav_filter(app):
        return SwiftClamavMiddleware(app, conf)
    return clamav_filter
{% endsyntax %}

I'm not going to expand more on why this is built this way, but if you want
to have more info on this kind of filter middleware, you can read
[their documentation on Paste](http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#paste-filter-factory).

This middleware will just do nothing as it is. It's going to simply pass all
requests it receives to the final application, and returns the result.

# Testing our basic middleware

<div class="pull-right thumbnail">
    <img width="180" src="/media/images/lolcat-testing.jpg">
</div>

Now is a really good time to add unit tests. I hope you didn't think we were
going to write code without some tests, right? It's really easy to test a
middleware, as we're going to use [WebOb](http://webob.org/) for that.

{% syntax python %}
import unittest
from webob import Request


class FakeApp(object):
    def __call__(self, env, start_response):
        return Response(body="FAKE APP")(env, start_response)


class TestSwiftClamavMiddleware(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.app = SwiftClamavMiddleware(FakeApp(), {})

    def test_simple_request(self):
        resp = Request.blank('/',
                             environ={
                                 'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
                             }).get_response(self.app)
        self.assertEqual(resp.body, "FAKE APP")
{% endsyntax %}

We create a FakeApp class, that represents a fake WSGI application. You
could also use a real application, or write a fake application looking like
the one you want to test. It'll require more time, but your tests will be
closer to the reality.

Here we write the simplest test we can for our middleware. We're just
sending a _GET /_ request to it, so it passes the request to the final
application and returns the result. It is transparent, it does nothing.

Now, with that solid base we'll able to add more features and test these
features incrementally.

# Plugging ClamAV in

With our base ready, we can start thinking about how to plug ClamAV in. What
we want to check here, is the content of the file when it's uploaded.
If we refer to the
[OpenStack object storage API](http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-object-storage/1.0/content/)
, a file upload is done via a _PUT_ request, so we're going to limit the
check to that kind of requests. Obviously, more checks could be added, but
we'll keep things simple here for the sake of comprehensibility.

With WSGI, the content of the request is available in _env['wsgi.input']_ as
an object implementing a file interface. We'll scan that stream with ClamAV
to check for viruses.

{% syntax python %}
import pyclamd
from webob import Response


class SwiftClamavMiddleware(object):
    """Middleware doing virus scan for Swift."""

    def __init__(self, app, conf):
        pyclamd.init_unix_socket('/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl')
        # app is the final application
        self.app = app

    def __call__(self, env, start_response):
        if env['REQUEST_METHOD'] == "PUT":
            # We have to read the whole content in memory because pyclamd
            # forces us to, but this is a bad idea if the file is huge.
            scan = pyclamd.scan_stream(env['wsgi.input'].read())
            if scan:
                return Response(status=403,
                                body="Virus %s detected" % scan['stream'],
                                content_type="text/plain")(env, start_response)
        return self.app(env, start_response)


def filter_factory(global_conf, **local_conf):
    conf = global_conf.copy()
    conf.update(local_conf)

    def clamav_filter(app):
        return SwiftClamavMiddleware(app, conf)
    return clamav_filter
{% endsyntax %}

That's it. We only check for _PUT_ requests and if there's a virus in the
file, we return a 403 Forbidden error with the name of the detected virus,
bypassing entirely the rest of the middleware chain and the application
handling.

Then, we can simply test it.

{% syntax python %}
import unittest
from cStringIO import StringIO
from webob import Request, Response


class FakeApp(object):
    def __call__(self, env, start_response):
        return Response(body="FAKE APP")(env, start_response)


class TestSwiftClamavMiddleware(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = SwiftClamavMiddleware(FakeApp(), {})

    def test_put_empty(self):
        resp = Request.blank('/v1/account/container/object',
                             environ={
                                 'REQUEST_METHOD': 'PUT',
                             }).get_response(self.app)
        self.assertEqual(resp.body, "FAKE APP")

    def test_put_no_virus(self):
        resp = Request.blank('/v1/account/container/object',
                             environ={
                                 'REQUEST_METHOD': 'PUT',
                                 'wsgi.input': StringIO('foobar')
                             }).get_response(self.app)
        self.assertEqual(resp.body, "FAKE APP")

    def test_put_virus(self):
        resp = Request.blank('/v1/account/container/object',
                             environ={
                                 'REQUEST_METHOD': 'PUT',
                                 'wsgi.input': StringIO(pyclamd.EICAR)
                             }).get_response(self.app)
        self.assertEqual(resp.status_code, 403)
{% endsyntax %}

The first test _test_put_empty_ simulates an empty _PUT_ request. The second
one, _test_put_no_virus_ simulates a regular _PUT_ request but with a simple
file containing no virus.

Finally, the third and last test simulates the upload of a virus using the
[EICAR](http://www.eicar.org/) test file. This is a special test file that
is recognized as a virus, even if it's not real one. Very handy for testing
virus detection software!

# Configuring Swift proxy

Our middleware is ready! We can configure Swift's proxy server to use it. We
need to add the following lines to our _swift-proxy.conf_ to teach it how to
load the filter:

{% syntax ini %}
[filter:clamav]
paste.filter_factory = swiftclamav:filter_factory
{% endsyntax %}

We'll assume that our Python modules is named *swiftclamava* here. Now that
we've defined our filter and how to load it, we can use it in our pipeline:

{% syntax ini %}
[pipeline:main]
pipeline = catch_errors healthcheck cache ratelimit tempauth clamav proxy-logging proxy-server
{% endsyntax %}

Just before reaching the _proxy-server_, and after the user being
authenticated, the content will be scanned for viruses. It's important here
to put this after authentication for example, because otherwise we may scan
content that will get rejected by the authtemp module, thus scanning for
nothing!

# Beyond scanning

And voilà, we now have a simple middleware testing uploaded content and
refusing infected files. We could enhance it with various other things, like
configuration handling, but I'll let that as an exercise for the interested
readers.

We didn't exploited it here, but note that you can also manipulate request
headers and modify them if needed. For example, we could have added a header
*X-Object-Meta-Scanned-By: ClamAV* to indicates that the file has been
scanned by ClamAV.

You should now be able to build your own middleware doing whatever you want
with uploaded data. Happy hacking!
