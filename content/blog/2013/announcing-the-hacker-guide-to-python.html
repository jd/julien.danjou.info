I've been hacking on Python for a lot of years now, on various project. For
the last two years, I've beenheavily involved in
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org), which makes an heavy usage of Python.

Once you start working with a hundred of hackers, on several software and
libraries representing more than half a million source lines of Python,
things change. The scalability, testing and deployment problems inherent to
a cloud platform meddle with everything in designing components.

During these two years working on OpenStack development, I've learned a lot
on Python from astounding Python hackers. From general architecture and
design principles to various tips and tricks of the language.

It seemed to me like a good opportunity to share what I learnt doing so with
others so you can benefit from it in other projects. I've started working a
book, entitled "The Hacker's Guide to Python", where I will try to share
what I learnt while working with Python.

The book is still a work in progress at this stage, but if you'd like to get
in touch and keep updated on its advancement, you can subscribe in the
following form or from the <a href="/books/the-hacker-guide-to-python">book
homepage</a>.
