I love to say that Python is a nice subset of Lisp, and I discover that it's
getting even more true as time passes. Recently, I've stumbled upon the
[PEP 443](http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/) that describes a way to
dispatch generic functions, in a way that looks like what CLOS, the Common
Lisp Object System, provides.

## What are generic functions

If you come from the Lisp world, this won't be something new to you. The
Lisp object system provides a really good way to define and handle method
dispatching. It's a base of the Common Lisp object system.
For my own pleasure to see Lisp code in a Python post, I'll show you how
generic methods work in Lisp first.

To begin, let's define a few very simple classes.

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass snare-drum ()
  ())

(defclass cymbal ()
  ())

(defclass stick ()
  ())

(defclass brushes ()
  ())
{% endsyntax %}

This defines a few classes: `snare-drum`, `symbal`, `stick` and `brushes`,
without any parent class nor attribute. These classes compose a drum kit,
and we can combine them to play sound. So we define a `play` method that
takes two arguments, and returns a sound (as a string).

{% syntax cl %}
(defgeneric play (instrument accessory)
  (:documentation "Play sound with instrument and accessory."))
{% endsyntax %}

This only defines a generic method: it has no body, and cannot be called
with any instance yet. At this stage, we only inform the object system that
the method is generic and can be then implemented with various type of
arguments. We'll start by implementing versions of this method that knows
how to play with the snare-drum.

{% syntax cl %}
(defmethod play ((instrument snare-drum) (accessory stick))
  "POC!")

(defmethod play ((instrument snare-drum) (accessory brushes))
  "SHHHH!")
{% endsyntax %}

Now we just defined concrete methods with code. They also takes two
arguments: `instrument` which is an instance of `snare-drum` and `accessory`
that is an instance of `stick` or `brushes`.

At this stage, you should note the first difference with object system as
built into language like Python: the method isn't tied to any class in
particular. The methods are *generic*, and any class can implement them, or
not.

Let's try it.

{% syntax cl %}
* (play (make-instance 'snare-drum) (make-instance 'stick))
"POC!"

* (play (make-instance 'snare-drum) (make-instance 'brushes))
"SHHHH!"

* (play (make-instance 'cymbal) (make-instance 'stick))
debugger invoked on a SIMPLE-ERROR in thread
#<THREAD "main thread" RUNNING {1002ADAF23}>:
  There is no applicable method for the generic function
    #<STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION PLAY (2)>
  when called with arguments
    (#<CYMBAL {1002B801D3}> #<STICK {1002B82763}>).

Type HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:EXIT) to exit from SBCL.

restarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):
  0: [RETRY] Retry calling the generic function.
  1: [ABORT] Exit debugger, returning to top level.

((:METHOD NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD (T)) #<STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION PLAY (2)> #<CYMBAL {1002B801D3}> #<STICK {1002B82763}>) [fast-method]
{% endsyntax %}

As you see, the function called depends on the class of the arguments. The
object systems **dispatch** the function calls to the right function for us,
depending on the arguments classes. If we call `play` with instances that
are not know to the object system, an error will be thrown.


Inheritance is also supported and the equivalent (but more powerful and less
error prone) equivalent of Python's `super()` is available via
`(call-next-method)`.

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass snare-drum () ())
(defclass cymbal () ())

(defclass accessory () ())
(defclass stick (accessory) ())
(defclass brushes (accessory) ())

(defmethod play ((c cymbal) (a accessory))
  "BIIING!")

(defmethod play ((c cymbal) (b brushes))
  (concatenate 'string "SSHHHH!" (call-next-method)))
{% endsyntax %}

In this example, we define the `stick` and `brushes` classes as subclass of
the `accessory` class. The `play` method defined will return the sound
_BIIING!_ regardless of the accessory instance that is used to play the
cymbal. Except in the case where it's a `brushes` instance; only the most
precise method is always called. The `(call-next-method)` function is used
to call the closest parent method, in this case that would be the method
returning _"BIIING!".

{% syntax cl %}
* (play (make-instance 'cymbal) (make-instance 'stick))
"BIIING!"

* (play (make-instance 'cymbal) (make-instance 'brushes))
"SSHHHH!BIIING!"
{% endsyntax %}

Note that CLOS is also able to dispatch on object instances themself by
using the `eql` specializer.

But if you're really curious about all features CLOS provides, I suggest you
read the
[brief guide to CLOS by Jeff Dalton](http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~jeff/clos-guide.html)
as a starter.

## Python implementation

Python implements a simpler equivalence of this workflow with the
`singledispatch` function. It will be provided with Python 3.4 as part of
the `functools` module. Here's a rough equivalence of the above Lisp
program.

{% syntax python %}
import functools

class SnareDrum(object): pass
class Cymbal(object): pass
class Stick(object): pass
class Brushes(object): pass

@functools.singledispatch
def play(instrument, accessory):
    raise NotImplementedError("Cannot play these")

@play.register(SnareDrum)
def _(instrument, accessory):
    if isinstance(accessory, Stick):
        return "POC!"
    if isinstance(accessory, Brushes):
        return "SHHHH!"
    raise NotImplementedError("Cannot play these")
{% endsyntax %}

We define our four classes, and a base `play` function that raises
`NotImplementedError`, indicating that by default we don't know what to do.
We can then write specialized version of this function with a first
instrument, the `SnareDrum`. We then check for the accessory type that we
get, and return the appropriate sound or raise `NotImplementedError` again
if we don't know what to do with it.

If we run it, it works as expected:

{% syntax python %}
>>> play(SnareDrum(), Stick())
'POC!'
>>> play(SnareDrum(), Brushes())
'SHHHH!'
>>> play(Cymbal(), Brushes())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/jd/Source/cpython/Lib/functools.py", line 562, in wrapper
    return dispatch(args[0].__class__)(*args, **kw)
  File "/home/jd/sd.py", line 10, in play
    raise NotImplementedError("Cannot play these")
NotImplementedError: Cannot play these
>>> play(SnareDrum(), Cymbal())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/jd/Source/cpython/Lib/functools.py", line 562, in wrapper
    return dispatch(args[0].__class__)(*args, **kw)
  File "/home/jd/sd.py", line 18, in _
    raise NotImplementedError("Cannot play these")
NotImplementedError: Cannot play these
{% endsyntax %}

The `singledispatch` module looks through the classes of the first argument
passed to the `play` function, and calls the right version of it. The first
defined version of the `play` function is always run for the `object` class,
so if our instrument is a class that we did not register for, this base
function will be called.

For whose eager to try and use it, the `singledispatch` function is
[provided Python 2.6 to 3.3 through the Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/singledispatch/).

## Limitations

First, as you noticed in the Lisp version, CLOS provides a multiple
dispatcher that can dispatch on the tye pof **any of the argument** defined
in the method prototype, not only the first one. Unfortunately, Python
dispatcher is named _singledispatch_ for this good reason: it only knows to
dispatch on the first argument. Guido van Rossum wrote a short article about
the subject that he called
[multimethod](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=101605) a
few years ago.

Then, there's no way to call the parent function directly. There's no
equivalent of the `(call-next-method)` from Lisp nor the `super()` function
that allows to do that in Python class system. This means you will have to
use various trick to bypass this limitation.

So while I am really glad that Python is going toward that direction, as
it's a really powerful way to enhance an object system, it really lacks a
lot of more advanced features that CLOS provides out of the box.

Though, improving this could be an interesting challenge. Especially to
bring more CLOS power to [Hy](http://hylang.org). :-)
