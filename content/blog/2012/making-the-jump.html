For the last 10 years, I've been working on many Free Software projects.
From [Debian](http://www.debian.org) to [OpenStack](http://openstack.org),
through [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org),
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org) and [many
more](http://julien.danjou.info/projects). This obviously allowed me to
enhance my technical skills, but it also taught me about Free Software and
Open Source development processes, and how to work with and close to the
community.

Working for almost 6 years at [Easter-eggs](http://easter-eggs.com) taught
me how to work in an autonomous manner, how to lead and manage a project.
And how to run a company, thanks to the cooperative status of this great
one.

These are the reasons why I decided to leave my latest job and run my own
company to work as a [freelance consultant &
developer](http://julien.danjou.info/freelance) specialized in Free
Software, starting today.

Therefore, I am now able and available to provide expertise and development
on Free Software, including upstream contribution. Especially on projects I
already worked on recently, like [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org).
