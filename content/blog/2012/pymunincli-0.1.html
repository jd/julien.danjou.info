{% mark excerpt %}

Today I release a [Python](http://python.org) client library to query
[Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/) servers.

{% endmark %}

I wrote it as part of some experiments I did a few weeks ago. I discovered
there was no client library to query a Munin server. There's
[PyMunin](http://aouyar.github.com/PyMunin/) or
[python-munin](http://samuelks.com/python-munin/) which help developing
Munin plugins, but nothing to access the *munin-node* and retrieve its data.

So I decided to write a quick and simple one, and it's released under the
name of [PyMuninCli](http://julien.danjou.info/software/pymunincli/),
providing the *munin.client* Python module.
