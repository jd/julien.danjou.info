{% mark excerpt %}

[Swift](https://launchpad.net/swift) is the software behind the [OpenStack
Object Storage](http://openstack.org/projects/storage/) service.

This service provides a simple storage service for applications using
[RESTful
interfaces](http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-object-storage/1.0/content/),
providing maximum data availability and storage capacity.

I explain here how some parts of the storage and replication in Swift works,
and show some of its current limitations.

If you don't know Swift and want to read a more "shallow" overview first,
you can read John Dickinson's [Swift Tech
Overview](http://programmerthoughts.com/openstack/swift-tech-overview/).

# How Swift storage works

If we refer to the [CAP theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem),
Swift chose **availability** and **partition tolerance** and dropped
**consistency**. That means that you'll always get your data, they will be
dispersed on many places, but you could get an old version of them (or no
data at all) in some odd cases (like some server overload or failure). This
compromise is made to allow maximum availability and scalability of the
storage platform.

But there are mechanisms built into Swift to minimize the potential data
inconsistency window: they are responsible for data replication and
consistency.

The [official Swift documentation](http://swift.openstack.org/) explains the
internal storage in a certain way, but I'm going to write my own explanation
here about this.

## Consistent hashing

Swift uses the principle of [consistent
hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing). It builds what it
calls a *ring*. A ring represents the space of all possible computed hash
values divided in equivalent parts. Each part of this space is called a
*partition*.

The following schema (stolen from the [Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/)
project) shows the principle nicely:

![Consistent hashing ring](/media/images/blog/2012/riak-ring.png)

In a simple world, if you wanted to store some objects and distribute them
on 4 nodes, you would split your hash space in 4. You would have 4
partitions, and computing *hash(object) modulo 4* would tell you where to
store your object: on node 0, 1, 2 or 3.

But since you want to be able to extend your storage cluster to more nodes
without breaking the whole hash mapping and moving everything around, you
need to build a lot more partitions. Let's say we're going to build
2<sup>10</sup> partitions. Since we have 4 nodes, each node will
have <code>2<sup>10</sup> ÷ 4 = 256</code> partitions. If we ever want to
add a 5<sup>th</sup> node, it's easy: we just have to re-balance the
partitions and move 1⁄4 of the partitions from each node to this
5<sup>th</sup> node. That means all our nodes will end up
with <code>2<sup>10</sup> ÷ 5 ≈ 204</code> partitions. We can also define a
*weight* for each node, in order for some nodes to get more partitions than
others.

With 2<sup>10</sup> partitions, we can have up to 2<sup>10</sup> nodes in our
cluster. Yeepee.

For reference, Gregory Holt, one of the Swift authors, also wrote [an
explanation post about the
ring](http://www.tlohg.com/p/building-consistent-hashing-ring.html).

Concretely, when building one Swift ring, you'll have to say how much
partitions you want, and this is what this value is really about.

## Data duplication

Now, to assure availability and partitioning (as seen in the *CAP theorem*)
we also want to store replicas of our objects. By default, Swift stores 3
copies of every objects, but that's configurable.

In that case, we need to store each partition defined above not only on 1
node, but on 2 others. So Swift adds another concept: zones. A zone is an
isolated space that does not depends on other zone, so in case of an outage
on a zone, the other zones are still available. Concretely, a zone is likely
to be a disk, a server, or a whole cabinet, depending on the size of your
cluster. It's up to you to chose anyway.

Consequently, each partitions has not to be mapped to 1 host only anymore,
but to N hosts. Each node will therefore store this number of partitions:

<pre>
number of partition stored on one node = number of replicas × total number of partitions ÷ number of node
</pre>

Examples:

<blockquote>
We split the ring in 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 partitions. We have 3 nodes. We want 3 replicas of data.<br>
→ Each node will store a copy of the full partition space: <code>3 × 2<sup>10</sup> ÷ 3 = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 partitions</code>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We split the ring in 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 partitions. We have 5 nodes. We want 3 replicas of data.<br>
→ Each node will store <code>2<sup>11</sup> × 3 ÷ 5 ≈ 1129 partitions</code>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We split the ring in 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 partitions. We have 6 nodes. We want 3 replicas of data.<br>
→ Each node will store <code>2<sup>11</sup> × 3 ÷ 6 = 1024 partitions</code>.
</blockquote>


## Three rings to rule them all

In Swift, there is 3 categories of thing to store: *account*, *container*
and *objects*.

An **account** is what you'd expect it to be, a user account. An account
contains **containers** (the equivalent of Amazon S3's buckets). Each
container can contains user-defined key and values (just like a hash table
or a dictionary): values are what Swift call **objects**.

Swift wants you to build 3 different and independent rings to store its 3
kind of things (*accounts*, *containers* and *objects*).

Internally, the two first categories are stored as
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) databases, whereas the last one is stored
using regular files.

Note that this 3 rings can be stored and managed on 3 completely different
set of servers.

# Data replication

Now that we have our storage theory in place (accounts, containers and
objects distributed into partitions, themselves stored into multiple zones),
let's go the replication practice.

When you put something in one of the 3 rings (being an account, a container
or an object) it is uploaded into all the zones responsible for the ring
partition the object belongs to. This upload into the different zones is the
responsibility of the *swift-proxy* daemon.

![Swift proxy schema](/media/images/blog/2012/openstack-swift-replication.png)

But if one of the zone is failing, you can't upload all your copies in all
zones at the upload time. So you need a mechanism to be sure the failing
zone will catch up to a correct state at some point.

That's the role of the *swift-{container,account,object}-replicator*
processes. This processes are **running on each node part of a zone** and
replicates their contents to nodes of the other zones.

When they run, they walk through all the contents from all the partitions on
the whole file system and for each partition, issue a special *REPLICATE*
HTTP request to all the other zones responsible for that same partition. The
other zone responds with information about the local state of the partition.
That allows the replicator process to decide if the remote zone has an
up-to-date version of the partition.

In case of account and containers, it doesn't check at the partition level,
but check each account/container contained inside each partition.

If something is not up-to-date, it will be pushed using *rsync* by the
replicator process. This is why you'll read that the replication updates are
*"push based"* in Swift documentation.

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Pseudo code describing replication process for accounts
# The principle is exactly the same for containers
for account in accounts:
    # Determine the partition used to store this account
    partition = hash(account) % number_of_partitions
    # The number of zone is the number of replicas configured
    for zone in partition.get_zones_storing_this_partition():
        # Send a HTTP REPLICATE command to the remote swift-account-server process
        version_of_account = zone.send_HTTP_REPLICATE_for(account):
        if version_of_account < account.version()
            account.sync_to(zone)
</pre>

This replication process is *O(number of account × number of replicas)*. The
more your number of account will increase and the more you will want
replicas for your data, the more the replication time for your accounts will
grow. The same rule applies for containers.

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Pseudo code describing replication process for objects
for partition in partitions_storing_objects:
    # The number of zone is the number of replicas configured
    for zone in partition.get_zones_storing_this_partition():
        # Send a HTTP REPLICATE command to the remote swift-object-server process
        verion_of_partition = zone.send_HTTP_REPLICATE_for(partition):
        if version_of_partition < partition.version()
            # Use rsync to synchronize the whole partition
            # and all its objects
            partition.rsync_to(zone)
</pre>

This replication process is
*O(number of objects partitions × number of replicas)*. The more your
number of objects partitions will increase, and the more you will want
replicas for your data, the more the replication time for your objects will
grow.

I think this is something important to know when deciding how to build your
Swift architecture. Choose the right number the number of replicas,
partitions and nodes.

## File accesses

The problem, as you might have guessed, is that to replicate, **it walks
through every damn things**, things being accounts, containers, or object's
partition hash files. This means it need to open and read (part of) a every
file your node stores to check that data need or not to be replicated!

For accounts & containers replication, this is done every 30 seconds by
default, but it will likely take more than 30 seconds as soon as you hit
around 12 000 containers on a node (see measurements below). Therefore
you'll end up checking consistency of accounts & containers on each all node
**all the time**, using obviously a lot of CPU time.

For reference, [Alex Yang also did an
analysis](http://alexyang.sinaapp.com/?p=115) of that same problem.

## TCP connections

Worst, the HTTP connections used to send the *REPLICATE* commands are not
pooled: a new TCP connection is established each time something has to be
checked against the same thing stored on a remote zone.

This is why you'll see in the [Swift's Deployment
Guide](http://swift.openstack.org/deployment_guide.html) this lines listed
under ["general system
tuning"](http://swift.openstack.org/deployment_guide.html#general-system-tuning):

<pre class="prettyprint">
# disable TIME_WAIT.. wait..
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1

# double amount of allowed conntrack
net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 262144
</pre>

In my humble opinion, this is more an ugly hack than a tuning. If you don't
activate this and if you have a lot of containers on your node, you'll end
up soon with thousands of connections in *TIME_WAIT* state, and you indeed
risk to overload the IP conntrack module.

## Container deletion

We also should talk about container deletion. When a user deletes a
container from its account, the container is **marked as deleted**. And
that's it. It's not deleted. Therefore the SQLite database file representing
the container will continue to be checked for synchronization, over and
over.

The only way to have a container permanently deleted is to **mark an account
as deleted**. This way the *swift-account-reaper* will delete all its
containers and, finally, the account.

# Measurement

On a pretty big server, I measured the replications to be done at a speed of
around 350 {account,container,object-partitions}/second, which can be a real
problem if you chose to build a lots of partition and you have a low
*number_of_node ⁄ number_of_replicas* ratio.

For example, the default parameters runs the container replication every 30
seconds. To check replication status of 12 000 containers stored on one node
at the speed of 350 containers/seconds, you'll need around 34 seconds to do
so. In the end, you'll never stop checking replication of your containers,
and the more you'll have containers, the more your **inconsistency window
will increase**.

# Conclusion

Until some of the code is fixed (the HTTP connection pooling probably being
the "easiest" one), I warmly recommend to chose correctly the different
Swift parameters for your setup. The replication process optimization
consists in having the minimum amount of partitions per node, which can be
done by:

- decreasing the number of partitions
- decreasing the number of replicas
- increasing the number of node

For very large setups, some code to speed up accounts and containers
synchronization, and remove deleted containers will be required, but this
does not exist yet, as far as I know.
