Ten years ago, I joined the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) project as a developer.
{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

At that time, I was 18 and in my first year at university, hanging out with
the [TuxFamily](http://tuxfamily.org) system administrators, which included
3 french Debian developers (sjg, igenibel and creis).

I was learning Debian packaging while working on [VHFFS](http://vhffs.org),
and decided to package one or two non-yet-packaged software for Debian. My
friends pushed me into the [NM process](http://nm.debian.org), and [less
than 2 months later](https://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=acid@hno3.org)
I was a Debian developer. One have to admit that back in the days, the NM
process was really fast if you were able to reply to the questions quickly.
:-) I think I became the youngest developer among Debian's ones.

That was my first steps in a Free Software project, and it was really
exciting.

In 10 years, I've been doing a lot of different things for Debian. Sure,
I've been using it all the years long, but let's recap a bit what I did,
from what I recall.

My first Debian only project was
[apt-build](http://packages.debian.org/apt-build) around 2003, and later
[rebuildd](http://packages.debian.org/rebuildd) in 2007.

I built the [Xen packaging team](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-xen/) in 2005,
I've been a Stable Release Manager for a year in 2006, and did heavy bug
squashing to release Etch that same year.

I also was an [Application Manager in
2006](https://nm.debian.org/whoisam.php) and managed the application of 2
Debian developers ([Jose
Parrella](https://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=joseparrella%40cantv.net)
and [Damián
Viano](https://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=debian%40damianv.com.ar)).

I admit I've been less active in Debian after 2007, mainly because I was
busy working on [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org), [GNU
Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and others software.

Since 2011, I joined the [OpenStack packaging
team](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/openstack/) and I'm working on
OpenStack on a (almost) daily basis.

I don't know how many packages I touched, managed or updated, but that
should be one or two hundreds. I still maintain [53 of
them](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=acid).

After all, the adventure has been really pleasant, and I had the chance to
work with and meet fabulous and smart people. I always liked this project
and what it's trying to do.

After all these years, I'm definitively staying!
See you in another 10 years, folks! :)
