{% mark excerpt %}

For the last months, I've been working on a metering project for
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org), so it's time to talk a bit about it.

{% endmark %}

OpenStack is a growing cloud platform providing
<acronym title="Infrastructure as a Service">IaaS</a>. A problem easily
identified by everyone building a public cloud platform is that nothing is
provided to retrieve the platform usage data. Some data are available in
some places, but not everything is, and you have to do a lot of processing
from the various components to get something useful in the end.
But in order to bill customers that are using your public cloud platform,
you need to dot his.

In this regard, a lot of companies running public OpenStack based
infrastructure wrote their own solution to cover this functional areas, and
to become able to bill theirs customers.

To avoid everybody doing and maintaining such a stack in their corners, the
[Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer) has been created.

The project aims to cover the metering aspect of the OpenStack components,
pulling usage data from every components and storing them into a single
place. It then offer a retrieving point for this data via a REST API.

The [initial specifications](http://wiki.openstack.org/EfficientMetering)
have been written in April this year, and actual implementation started in
May. The project is currently worked on by me, Dreamhost and Canonical.

We already have designed [an
architecture](http://wiki.openstack.org/EfficientMetering/ArchitectureProposalV1)
that we are implementing, and we hope to release a first usable version with
Folsom.

I did [a
presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11ALGC4xuWcRvXKTSnnsteJUkArsTfQW-7IAfWRRI5kQ/edit#slide=id.p)
of this project yesterday at [XLCloud](http://xlcloud.org/bin/view/Main/),
which has been very well received.

If you are interested in helping us and contributing, feel free to join us
during one of our [weekly IRC
meeting](http://wiki.openstack.org/Meetings/MeteringAgenda) or fix [some
bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer). :-)
