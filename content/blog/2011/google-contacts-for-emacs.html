That's now possible, thanks to my new
[google-contacts.el]({{site.url}}/software/google-contacts.el)

It includes searching for any contact and displaying the result in a window.
You can also jump to a contact from [Gnus](http://gnus.org) by pressing a
key, and complete e-mail addresses while composing a mail.
