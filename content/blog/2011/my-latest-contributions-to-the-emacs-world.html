I spend too much time writing Emacs Lisp code these days. Unfortunately, the
more I do the more I find new useful tools to improve my work-flow and save
time for doing more Lisp. D'oh.

{% endmark %}

I did not work on any big thing these last weeks, so I'm thinking it's a
good time to talk about the various code and patches I sent to multiple
Emacs packages.

# el-get
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get),
a fabulous tool that installs and handles all the external Emacs
packages I use. A friendly war started on the [development list](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.el-get.devel) about
autoloads handling. The discussion was overall pointless, since we had a
very hard time to communicate our ideas, and we did not understand each
others several times.

In the end, *el-get* now supports autoload correctly and do not load
automatically all your packages, improving the startup time, and using the
Emacs way to do things. Which is always better, obviously.

# git-commit-mode
I've started to use [git-commit-mode](https://github.com/rafl/git-commit-mode) some times ago. I usually use *git-commit*
with the *-v* option to see what I'm committing. I though it would be useful
to color the diff with *diff-mode*, so I [wrote a patch](https://github.com/rafl/git-commit-mode/commit/3e2d1047fff31358c39486cd890d1eb87a464404) just to do that, which
was merged today by Florian.

# magit
Some weeks ago, I decided to give a try to [magit](http://philjackson.github.com/magit/), and loved it. I am not
always using it, but for basic operations it is very useful. But I really
soon found some things I did not like and therefore send patches to enhance
it.

First, I've added [a patch to honor status.showUntrackedFiles](https://github.com/philjackson/magit/commit/0314e7fd1df2b37b3cd1699afdf2dc3b98aee2d1) which I use in
my home directory. In the mean time, I've also added
[a patch to allow adding an arbitrary file](https://github.com/philjackson/magit/commit/43cd05081b7e60d3f2dcce696f3a07c135f4e306).

Yesterday, I sent another [pull request](https://github.com/philjackson/magit/pull/128), not closed for now, which adds the
[possibility to visit files in another window](https://github.com/jd/magit/commit/73afce9f0220146a55c6c63735ce48561a277632) from a diff file, and
[the support for add-change-log-entry](https://github.com/jd/magit/commit/82d43edb123f493d639ef0835734e58fca1b8c0a) directly from the displayed diff.
Useful for these old projects still using *ChangeLog* files but accessible
through git (hi Emacs & Gnus!).

# Gnus
Nothing remarkable, but I write a couple of [fixes](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/commit/?id=3ccee76adca8a830cf781e697119b980cd9fcbe1)
and [enhancements](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/commit/?id=01c211faea248b5d9e35f3662670bb8d12b9b137) to the
Sieve manage mode, to the [Gravatar code](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/commit/?id=d715adda2809176649227153d9e97564e755efb6) and cleaned-up some very very old
code. Also added the possibility to
[set list-identifier as a group parameter](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/commit/?id=2bd6537597f51762a4b04f81c70d8f2be5dcb690).

# Org-mode
I spent most of my time working on my [jd/agenda-format](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=~jd/org-mode.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/jd/agenda-format) branch, which is soon
to be merged. I've also just got developer access to the Org-mode patch work
and repository, so I'll be able to break things even more! ;-)

# ERC
I [fixed](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=391de97a758c44e5d38e0c8f0bd50fe5eae09d5f) **the** bug that annoyed me for a long time. Now *erc-track* does not
reset the last channel status on window visibility changes not made by the
user.
