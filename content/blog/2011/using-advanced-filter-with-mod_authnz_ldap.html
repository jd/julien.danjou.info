As you may know, Apache's [mod_authzn_ldap](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html) allows to authenticate users in
Apache HTTP server using an LDAP server. Unfortunately, it has a little
implementation flaw.

{% endmark %}

The filter used to authenticate the user is built by abusing the [RFC 2255](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt)
which specifies the LDAP URL format. This format has an "attribute" field
which is normally used to specify which attributes should be returned. But
*mod_authzn_ldap* uses this attribute to compare with the username given by
the client. That means that you have to have an attribute in your LDAP
entries which matches the username, and you have to use it in the
"attribute" part of the URL to get things working.

Therefore, I wrote a patch to add a format string in the LDAP URL in order
to user the provided username in the filter, and ignore the attribute part
of the URL, which has no use in such a context anyway.

The bug has been opened in ASF Bugzilla and has number [#51005](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51005), with the
patch. The patch is backward compatible with the current configuration
format, which is not the best choice in theory, but probably the more
pragmatic.

I've no clue on the typical delay for patches in clusion in Apache HTTP
server, so le
t's just wait'n see.
