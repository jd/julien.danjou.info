And done! It took me just 8 months to do this entire book project around
Python. From the first day I started writing to today, where I finally
publish and sell – almost entirely – myself this book. I'm really proud of
what I've achieved so far, as this was something totally new to me.

Doing all of that has been a great adventure, and I'll promise I'll write
something about that later on. A making of.

For now, you can enjoy reading the book and learn a bit more about Python. I
really hope it'll help you bring your Python-fu to a new level, and help you
build great projects!
