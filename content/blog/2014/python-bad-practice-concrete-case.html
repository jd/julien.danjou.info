A lot of people read up on good Python practice, and there's plenty of
information about that on the Internet. Many tips are included in the book I
wrote this year,
[The Hacker's Guide to Python](/books/the-hacker-guide-to-python). Today I'd
like to show a concrete case of code that I don't consider being the state of
the art.

In my [last article](/blog/2014/openstack-ceilometer-the-gnocchi-experiment)
where I talked about my new project Gnocchi, I wrote about how I tested, hacked
and then ditched *[whisper](http://graphite.wikidot.com/whisper)* out. Here I'm
going to explain part of my thought process and a few things that raised my
eyebrows when hacking this code.

Before I start, please don't get the spirit of this article wrong. It's in no
way a personal attack to the authors and contributors (who I don't know).
Furthermore, *whisper* is a piece of code that is in production in thousands of
installation, storing metrics for years. While I can argue that I consider the
code not to be following best practice, it definitely works well enough and is
worthy to a lot of people.

# Tests

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/testtube_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

The first thing that I noticed when trying to hack on *whisper*, is the lack of
test. There's only one file containing tests, named `test_whisper.py`, and the
coverage it provides is pretty low. One can check that using the *coverage*
tool.

{% syntax %}
$ coverage run test_whisper.py
...........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 11 tests in 0.014s

OK
$ coverage report
Name           Stmts   Miss  Cover
----------------------------------
test_whisper     134      4    97%
whisper          584    227    61%
----------------------------------
TOTAL            718    231    67%
{% endsyntax %}

 While one would think that 61% is "not so bad", taking a quick peak at the
actual test code shows that the tests are incomplete. Why I mean by incomplete
is that they for example use the library to store values into a database, but
they never check if the results can be fetched and if the fetched results are
accurate. Here's a good reason one should never blindly trust the test cover
percentage as a quality metric.

When I tried to modify *whisper*, as the tests do not check the entire cycle of
the values fed into the database, I ended up doing wrong changes but had the
tests still pass.

# No PEP 8, no Python 3

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/codesearch_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-left"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

The code doesn't respect PEP 8 . A run of
[flake8](https://flake8.readthedocs.org/) +
[hacking](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hacking) shows 732 errors… While it does
not impact the code itself, it's more painful to hack on it than it is on most
Python projects.

The *hacking* tool also shows that the code is not Python 3 ready as there is
usage of Python 2 only syntax.

A good way to fix that would be to set up [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/)
and adds a few targets for PEP 8 checks and Python 3 tests. Even if the test
suite is not complete, starting by having flake8 run without errors and the few
unit tests working with Python 3 should put the project in a better light.

# Not using idiomatic Python

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/brain_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

A lot of the code could be simplified by using idiomatic Python. Let's take a
simple example:

{% syntax python %}
def fetch(path,fromTime,untilTime=None,now=None):
  fh = None
  try:
    fh = open(path,'rb')
    return file_fetch(fh, fromTime, untilTime, now)
  finally:
    if fh:
      fh.close()
{% endsyntax %}

That piece of code could be easily rewritten as:

{% syntax python %}
def fetch(path,fromTime,untilTime=None,now=None):
  with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    return file_fetch(fh, fromTime, untilTime, now)
{% endsyntax %}

This way, the function looks actually so simple that one can even wonder why it
should exists – but why not.

Usage of loops could also be made more Pythonic:

{% syntax python %}
for i,archive in enumerate(archiveList):
  if i == len(archiveList) - 1:
    break
{% endsyntax %}

could be actually:

{% syntax python %}
for i, archive in enumerate(itertools.islice(archiveList, len(archiveList) - 1):
{% endsyntax %}

That reduce the code size and makes it easier to read through the code.

# Wrong abstraction level

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/star_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-left"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

Also, one thing that I noticed in *whisper*, is that it abstracts its features
at the wrong level.

Take the `create()` function, it's pretty obvious:

{% syntax python %}
def create(path,archiveList,xFilesFactor=None,aggregationMethod=None,sparse=False,useFallocate=False):
  # Set default params
  if xFilesFactor is None:
    xFilesFactor = 0.5
  if aggregationMethod is None:
    aggregationMethod = 'average'

  #Validate archive configurations...
  validateArchiveList(archiveList)

  #Looks good, now we create the file and write the header
  if os.path.exists(path):
    raise InvalidConfiguration("File %s already exists!" % path)
  fh = None
  try:
    fh = open(path,'wb')
    if LOCK:
      fcntl.flock( fh.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX )

    aggregationType = struct.pack( longFormat, aggregationMethodToType.get(aggregationMethod, 1) )
    oldest = max([secondsPerPoint * points for secondsPerPoint,points in archiveList])
    maxRetention = struct.pack( longFormat, oldest )
    xFilesFactor = struct.pack( floatFormat, float(xFilesFactor) )
    archiveCount = struct.pack(longFormat, len(archiveList))
    packedMetadata = aggregationType + maxRetention + xFilesFactor + archiveCount
    fh.write(packedMetadata)
    headerSize = metadataSize + (archiveInfoSize * len(archiveList))
    archiveOffsetPointer = headerSize

    for secondsPerPoint,points in archiveList:
      archiveInfo = struct.pack(archiveInfoFormat, archiveOffsetPointer, secondsPerPoint, points)
      fh.write(archiveInfo)
      archiveOffsetPointer += (points * pointSize)

    #If configured to use fallocate and capable of fallocate use that, else
    #attempt sparse if configure or zero pre-allocate if sparse isn't configured.
    if CAN_FALLOCATE and useFallocate:
      remaining = archiveOffsetPointer - headerSize
      fallocate(fh, headerSize, remaining)
    elif sparse:
      fh.seek(archiveOffsetPointer - 1)
      fh.write('\x00')
    else:
      remaining = archiveOffsetPointer - headerSize
      chunksize = 16384
      zeroes = '\x00' * chunksize
      while remaining > chunksize:
        fh.write(zeroes)
        remaining -= chunksize
      fh.write(zeroes[:remaining])

    if AUTOFLUSH:
      fh.flush()
      os.fsync(fh.fileno())
  finally:
    if fh:
      fh.close()
{% endsyntax %}

The function is doing **everything**: checking if the file doesn't exist
already, opening it, building the structured data, writing this, building more
structure, then writing that, etc.

That means that the caller has to give a file path, even if it just wants a
*whipser* data structure to store itself elsewhere. `StringIO()` could be used
to fake a file handler, but it will fail if the call to `fcntl.flock()` is not
disabled – and it is inefficient anyway.

There's a lot of other functions in the code, such as for example
`setAggregationMethod()`, that mixes the handling of the files – even doing
things like `os.fsync()` – while manipulating structured data. This is
definitely not a good design, especially for a library, as it turns out reusing
the function in different context is near impossible.

# Race conditions

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/sackrace_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

There are race conditions, for example in `create()` (see added comment):

{% syntax python %}
if os.path.exists(path):
  raise InvalidConfiguration("File %s already exists!" % path)
fh = None
try:
  # TOO LATE I ALREADY CREATED THE FILE IN ANOTHER PROCESS YOU ARE GOING TO
  # FAIL WITHOUT GIVING ANY USEFUL INFORMATION TO THE CALLER :-(
  fh = open(path,'wb')
{% endsyntax %}

That code should be:

{% syntax python %}
try:
  fh = os.fdopen(os.open(path, os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL), 'wb')
except OSError as e:
  if e.errno = errno.EEXIST:
    raise InvalidConfiguration("File %s already exists!" % path)
{% endsyntax %}

to avoid any race condition.

# Unwanted optimization

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/stopwatch_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-left"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

We saw earlier the `fetch()` function that is barely useful, so let's take a
look at the `file_fetch()` function that it's calling.

{% syntax python %}
def file_fetch(fh, fromTime, untilTime, now = None):
  header = __readHeader(fh)
[...]
{% endsyntax %}

The first thing the function does is to read the header from the file handler.
Let's take a look at that function:

{% syntax python %}
def __readHeader(fh):
  info = __headerCache.get(fh.name)
  if info:
    return info

  originalOffset = fh.tell()
  fh.seek(0)
  packedMetadata = fh.read(metadataSize)

  try:
    (aggregationType,maxRetention,xff,archiveCount) = struct.unpack(metadataFormat,packedMetadata)
  except:
    raise CorruptWhisperFile("Unable to read header", fh.name)
[...]
{% endsyntax %}

The first thing the function does is to look into a cache. Why is there a cache?

It actually caches the header based with an index based on the file path
(`fh.name`). Except that if one for example decide not to use file and cheat
using `StringIO`, then it does not have any name attribute. So this code path
will raise an `AttributeError`.

One has to set a fake name manually on the `StringIO` instance, and it must be
unique so nobody messes with the cache

{% syntax python %}
import StringIO

packedMetadata = <some source>
fh = StringIO.StringIO(packedMetadata)
fh.name = "myfakename"
header = __readHeader(fh)
{% endsyntax %}

The cache may actually be useful when accessing files, but it's definitely
useless when not using files. But it's not necessarily true that the complexity
(even if small) that the cache adds is worth it. I doubt most of *whisper* based
tools are long run processes, so the cache that is really used when accessing
the files is the one handled by the operating system kernel, and this one is
going to be much more efficient anyway, and shared between processed.
There's also no expiry of that cache, which could end up of tons of memory used
and wasted.

# Docstrings

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/documents_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

None of the docstrings are written in a a parsable syntax like
[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). This means you cannot generate any
documentation in a nice format that a developer using the library could read
easily.

The documentation is also not up to date:

{% syntax python %}
def fetch(path,fromTime,untilTime=None,now=None):
  """fetch(path,fromTime,untilTime=None)
[...]
"""

def create(path,archiveList,xFilesFactor=None,aggregationMethod=None,sparse=False,useFallocate=False):
  """create(path,archiveList,xFilesFactor=0.5,aggregationMethod='average')
[...]
"""
{% endsyntax %}

This is something that could be avoided if a proper format was picked to write
the docstring. A tool cool be used to be noticed when there's a diversion
between the actual function signature and the documented one, like missing an
argument.

# Duplicated code

<img src="/media/images/blog/2014/duplicate_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-left"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

Last but not least, there's a lot of code that is duplicated around in the
scripts provided by *whisper* in its `bin` directory. Theses scripts should be
very lightweight and be using the `console_scripts` facility of *setuptools*,
but they actually contains a lot of (untested) code. Furthermore, some of that
code is partially duplicated from the `whisper.py` library which is against
[DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself).

# Conclusion

There are a few more things that made me stop considering *whisper*, but these
are part of the *whisper* features, not necessarily code quality. One can also
point out that the code is very condensed and hard to read, and that's a more
general problem about how it is organized and abstracted.

A lot of these defects are actually points that made me start writing
[The Hacker's Guide to Python](/books/the-hacker-guide-to-python) a year ago.
Running into this kind of code makes me think it was a really good idea to write
a book on advice to write better Python code!
