Yesterday, the second milestone of the Icehouse development branch of
Ceilometer has been released and is now available for testing and download.
This means the first half of the OpenStack *Icehouse* development has
passed!

# New features

For the
[Icehouse-1 milestone](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/icehouse-1),
we barely had enough time to implement 2 blueprints. We almost did a better
job this time, but finally only
[2 blueprints were implemented](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/icehouse-2)
again. This is really far from what we planned initially. The infrastructure
slowdown issues and the lower number of reviews is probably the root cause
here.

Anyway, Ceilometer now offers a
[REST API to accesses the stored event](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/specify-event-api).

The initial work to replace the `/v2/meters` endpoint with something more
RESTy has started with the
[implementation of `/v2/samples`](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/sample-api).

# Bug fixes

Thirty-one bugs were fixed, though most of them might not interest you so I
won't elaborate too much on that. Go read
[the list](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/icehouse-2) if you
are curious.

# Toward Icehouse 3

We now have 29 blueprints targeting the
[Ceilometer's third Icehouse milestone](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/icehouse-3),
with some of them are already started and ready to merge. However, it's
likely that we won't make all of them. As usual, the priority should
indicate how confident we are that we want and need a feature. Still, it's
likely the roadmap will be adjusted in the upcoming weeks. I'll try to make
sure we'll get there without too much trouble for the 6th March 2013. Stay
tuned!
