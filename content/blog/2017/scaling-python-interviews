The release date for [Scaling Python](http://scaling-python.com) is now very close! Today, I'd like to
talk a bit about the interviews that I've run those last months that are
featured in the book.

I'm glad that during those long weeks work, I have managed to find a Python
expert on each of the major topic covered in the book. They will provide
hindsight on the different subject covered and share their experience so you
can benefit from it!

Without further delay, ladies and gentlemen, here they are:

about different subjects. These contents broaden the scope and expand the view
of the themes covered through the chapters. I can't thank them all enough!
