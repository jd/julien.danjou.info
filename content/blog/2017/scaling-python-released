{% mark excerpt %}

I am proud to announce today the immediate release of <a
href="http://scaling-python.com"><em>Scaling Python</em></a>, my second book
about Python! It talks about the distribution and performance of applications
written in Python, and how to build them properly!

It took me a year to build this entirely new product around Python. It's an
exciting moment and I am sure it will enjoy many of my dear readers that are
waiting for it for a while now!

{% endmark %}

I've been able to build this using my last three years of experience working on
<a href="http://thehackerguidetopython.com"><em>The Hacker's Guide to
Python</em></a> â€“ an amazing adventure.

Starting now, you can enjoy reading the book and learn a bit more about
building distributed and scalable applications with Python. I really hope it'll
help you bring your Python-fu to a new level, and that it will help you build
great projects!

Since this is first days of sale, you will enjoy <strong>a 15%
discount</strong> on all packages for the next 48 hours!
