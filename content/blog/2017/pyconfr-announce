The French edition of the annual Python conference, [PyCon FR](https://pycon.fr/2017/), will happen
in Toulouse from 21st to 24th September.

I skipped the last few PyCon FR, but this year I will be back with a one-hour
long talk entitled "_Scalable and distributed applications in Python_". It will
take place on Saturday afternoon. I will lay out many topics that will be
covered in the book I'm working on, [Scaling Python](http://scaling-python.com)!

The Thursday and Friday will be dedicated to development sprints. I will be
there with my friend [Mehdi](https://blog.sileht.net/) running a session for [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz)! We'll spend
time teaching new contributors how to use it or how to send love and patches to
the project. If you're into Python and want to learn about time series
management, it's an excellent occasion to join us for some fun. ðŸ˜Ž
