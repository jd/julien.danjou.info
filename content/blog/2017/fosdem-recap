Last week-end, I was in Brussels, Belgium for the 2017 edition of
the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org), one of the greatest open source developer
conference.

This year, I decided to propose a talk about [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz)
which was accepted in
the [Python devroom](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/python/). The track
was very well organized (thanks to [St√©phane Wirtel](https://wirtel.be/)) and
I was able to present Gnocchi to a room full of Python developers!

I've explained why we created Gnocchi and how we did it, and finally briefly
explained how to use it with the command-line interface or in a Python
application using the [SDK](http://gnocchi.xyz/gnocchiclient).
