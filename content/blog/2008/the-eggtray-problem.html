{% mark excerpt %}

I still don't know why but many GTK+ applications use something called
eggtrayicon. As far as I know, *eggtrayicon.c* is a file written in 2002 by
Anders Carlsson which implements the [Freedesktop.org system
tray](http://standards.freedesktop.org/systemtray-spec/latest/) procotol for
GTK+ applications.

Problem is that this C file is used in dozens of programs and maybe more,
and is a bit bugged. I've already send patches for
[mail-notification](http://www.nongnu.org/mailnotify/) and
[Audacious](http://audacious-media-player.org).
[pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) is the first fixed implementation I found
and works quite well. Many other applications are probably affected.

That seems to me like a real problem. Multiple copy of bad code instead of
using [native GTK+ system tray
implementation](http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/2.14/GtkStatusIcon.html).

So please stop using this bad implementation…
