A few months ago, I wrote a long post about what I called back then the
"[Gnocchi experiment](/blog/2014/openstack-ceilometer-the-gnocchi-experiment)".
Time passed and we – me and the rest of the Gnocchi team – continued to work on
that project, finalizing it.

It's with a great pleasure that we are going to release our first *1.0* version
this month, roughly at the same time that the integrated
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) projects release their Kilo milestone. The
[first release candidate numbered 1.0.0rc1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnocchi)
has been released this morning!

# The problem to solve

Before I dive into Gnocchi details, it's important to have a good view of what
problems Gnocchi is trying to solve.

Most of the IT infrastructures out there consists of a set of resources. These
resources have properties: some of them are simple attributes whereas others
might be measurable quantities (also known as metrics).

And in this context, the cloud infrastructures make no exception. We talk about
instances, volumes, networks… which are all different kind of resources. The
problems that are arising with the cloud trend is the scalability of storing
all this data and being able to request them later, for whatever usage.

What Gnocchi provides is a REST API that allows the user to manipulate
resources (CRUD) and their attributes, while preserving the history of those
resources and their attributes.

Gnocchi is fully documented and the
[documentation is available online](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/gnocchi).
We are the first OpenStack project to require patches to *integrate the
documentation*. We want to raise the bar, so we took a stand on that. That's
part of our policy, the same way it's part of the OpenStack policy to require
unit tests.

I'm not going to paraphrase the whole Gnocchi documentation, which covers
things like installation (super easy), but I'll guide you through some basics
of the features provided by the REST API. I will show you some example so you
can have a better understanding of what you could leverage using Gnocchi!

# Handling metrics

<img src="/media/images/blog/2015/barchart_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

Gnocchi provides a full REST API to manipulate time-series that are called
_metrics_. You can easily create a metric using a simple HTTP request:

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/metric HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "archive_policy_name": "low"
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost/v1/metric/387101dc-e4b1-4602-8f40-e7be9f0ed46a
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
  "archive_policy": {
    "aggregation_methods": [
      "std",
      "sum",
      "mean",
      "count",
      "max",
      "median",
      "min",
      "95pct"
    ],
    "back_window": 0,
    "definition": [
      {
        "granularity": "0:00:01",
        "points": 3600,
        "timespan": "1:00:00"
      },
      {
        "granularity": "0:30:00",
        "points": 48,
        "timespan": "1 day, 0:00:00"
      }
    ],
    "name": "low"
  },
  "created_by_project_id": "e8afeeb3-4ae6-4888-96f8-2fae69d24c01",
  "created_by_user_id": "c10829c6-48e2-4d14-ac2b-bfba3b17216a",
  "id": "387101dc-e4b1-4602-8f40-e7be9f0ed46a",
  "name": null,
  "resource_id": null
}
{% endsyntax %}

The `archive_policy_name` parameter defines how the measures that are being
sent are going to be aggregated. You can also define archive policies using the
API and specify what kind of aggregation period and granularity you want. In
that case , the _low_ archive policy keeps 1 hour of data aggregated over 1
second and 1 day of data aggregated to 30 minutes. The functions used for
aggregations are the mathematical functions standard deviation, minimum,
maximum, … and even 95th percentile. All of that is obviously customizable and
you can create your own archive policies.

If you don't want to specify the archive policy manually for each metric, you
can also create _archive policy rule_, that will apply a specific archive
policy based on the metric name, e.g. metrics matching `disk.*` will be high
resolution metrics so they will use the `high` archive policy.

It's also worth noting Gnocchi is precise up to the nanosecond and is not tied
to the current time. You can manipulate and inject measures that are years old
and precise to the nanosecond. You can also inject points with old timestamps
(i.e. old compared to the most recent one in the timeseries) with an archive
policy allowing it (see `back_window` parameter).

It's then possible to send measure to this metric:

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/metric/387101dc-e4b1-4602-8f40-e7be9f0ed46a/measures HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "timestamp": "2014-10-06T14:33:57",
    "value": 43.1
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2014-10-06T14:34:12",
    "value": 12
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2014-10-06T14:34:20",
    "value": 2
  }
  ]
  
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
{% endsyntax %}

<figure class="illustration pull-right" style="width: 5%;">
  <img src="/media/images/swift-bird.png">
</figure>
<figure class="illustration pull-right" style="width: 5%;">
  <img src="/media/images/ceph-logo.png">
</figure>

These measure are synchronously aggregated and stored into the storage backend
configured. Our most scalable storage drivers for now are either based on
[Swift](http://launchpad.net/swift) or [Ceph](http://ceph.com) which are both
scalable storage objects systems.

It's then possible to retrieve these values:

{% syntax %}
GET /v1/metric/387101dc-e4b1-4602-8f40-e7be9f0ed46a/measures HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

[
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:30:00.000000Z",
    1800.0,
    19.033333333333335
  ],
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:33:57.000000Z",
    1.0,
    43.1
  ],
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:34:12.000000Z",
    1.0,
    12.0
  ],
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:34:20.000000Z",
    1.0,
    2.0
  ]
]
{% endsyntax %}

As older Ceilometer users might notice here, metrics are only storing points
and values, nothing fancy such as metadata anymore.

By default, values eagerly aggregated using mean are returned for all supported
granularities. You can obviously specify a time range or a different
aggregation function using the `aggregation`, `start` and `stop` query
parameter.

Gnocchi also supports doing aggregation across aggregated metrics:

{% syntax %}
GET /v1/aggregation/metric?metric=65071775-52a8-4d2e-abb3-1377c2fe5c55&metric=9ccdd0d6-f56a-4bba-93dc-154980b6e69a&start=2014-10-06T14:34&aggregation=mean HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

[
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:34:12.000000Z",
    1.0,
    12.25
  ],
  [
    "2014-10-06T14:34:20.000000Z",
    1.0,
    11.6
  ]
]
{% endsyntax %}

This computes the mean of mean for the metric
`65071775-52a8-4d2e-abb3-1377c2fe5c55` and
`9ccdd0d6-f56a-4bba-93dc-154980b6e69a` starting on 6th October 2014 at 14:34
UTC.

# Indexing your resources

<img src="/media/images/blog/2015/index_icon.png"
    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

Another object and concept that Gnocchi provides is the ability to manipulate
resources. There is a basic type of resource, called _generic_, which has very
few attributes. You can extend this type to specialize it, and that's what
Gnocchi does by default by providing resource types known for OpenStack such as
_instance_, _volume_, _network_ or even _image_.

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/resource/generic HTTP/1.1

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "75C44741-CC60-4033-804E-2D3098C7D2E9",
  "project_id": "BD3A1E52-1C62-44CB-BF04-660BD88CD74D",
  "user_id": "BD3A1E52-1C62-44CB-BF04-660BD88CD74D"
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://localhost/v1/resource/generic/75c44741-cc60-4033-804e-2d3098c7d2e9

Last-Modified: Fri, 17 Apr 2015 11:18:48 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
  "created_by_project_id": "ec181da1-25dd-4a55-aa18-109b19e7df3a",
  "created_by_user_id": "4543aa2a-6ebf-4edd-9ee0-f81abe6bb742",
  "ended_at": null,
  "id": "75c44741-cc60-4033-804e-2d3098c7d2e9",
  "metrics": {},
  "project_id": "bd3a1e52-1c62-44cb-bf04-660bd88cd74d",
  "revision_end": null,
  "revision_start": "2015-04-17T11:18:48.696288Z",
  "started_at": "2015-04-17T11:18:48.696275Z",
  "type": "generic",
  "user_id": "bd3a1e52-1c62-44cb-bf04-660bd88cd74d"
}
{% endsyntax %}

The resource is created with the UUID provided by the user. Gnocchi handles the
history of the resource, and that's what the `revision_start` and
`revision_end` fields are for. They indicates the lifetime of this revision of
the resource. The `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are also unique to this
resource revision and can be used in a subsequent request using `If-Match` or
`If-Not-Match` header, for example:

{% syntax %}
GET /v1/resource/generic/75c44741-cc60-4033-804e-2d3098c7d2e9 HTTP/1.1
If-Not-Match: "e3acd0681d73d85bfb8d180a7ecac75fce45a0dd"

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
{% endsyntax %}

Which is useful to synchronize and update any view of the resources you might
have in your application.

You can use the `PATCH` HTTP method to modify properties of the resource, which
will create a new revision of the resource. The history of the resources are
available via the REST API obviously.

The `metrics` properties of the resource allow you to link metrics to a
resource. You can link existing metrics or create new one dynamically:

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/resource/generic HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "AB68DA77-FA82-4E67-ABA9-270C5A98CBCB",
  "metrics": {
    "temperature": {
      "archive_policy_name": "low"
    }
  },
  "project_id": "BD3A1E52-1C62-44CB-BF04-660BD88CD74D",
  "user_id": "BD3A1E52-1C62-44CB-BF04-660BD88CD74D"
}

# Haystack, needle? Find!

With such a system, it becomes very easy to index all your resources, meter
them and retrieve this data. What's even more interesting is to query the
system to find and list the resources you are interested in!

You can search for a resource based on any field, for example:

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/search/resource/instance HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "=": {
    "user_id": "bd3a1e52-1c62-44cb-bf04-660bd88cd74d"
  }
}
{% endsyntax %}

That query will return a list of all resources owned by the `user_id`
`bd3a1e52-1c62-44cb-bf04-660bd88cd74d`.

You can do fancier queries such as retrieving all the instances started by a
user this month:

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/search/resource/instance HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 113

{
  "and": [
    {
      "=": {
        "user_id": "bd3a1e52-1c62-44cb-bf04-660bd88cd74d"
      }
    },
    {
      ">=": {
        "started_at": "2015-04-01"
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endsyntax %}

And you can even do fancier queries than the fancier ones (still following?).
What if we wanted to retrieve all the instances that were on host `foobar` the
15th April and who had already 30 minutes of uptime? Let's ask Gnocchi to look
in the history!

{% syntax %}
POST /v1/search/resource/instance?history=true HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 113

{
  "and": [
    {
      "=": {
        "host": "foobar"
      }
    },
    {
      ">=": {
        "lifespan": "1 hour"
      }
    },
    {
      "<=": {
        "revision_start": "2015-04-15"
      }
    }

  ]
}
{% endsyntax %}

I could also mention the fact that you can
[search for value in metrics](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/gnocchi/rest.html#searching-for-values-in-metrics).
One feature that I will very likely include in Gnocchi 1.1 is the ability to
search for resource whose specific metrics matches some value. For example,
having the ability to search for instances whose CPU consumption was over 80%
during a month.

# Cherries on the cake

While Gnocchi is well integrated and based on common OpenStack technology,
please do note that it is completely able to function without any other
OpenStack component and is pretty straight-forward to deploy.

Gnocchi also implements a full RBAC system based on the
[OpenStack standard oslo.policy](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.policy/)
and which allows pretty fine grained control of permissions.

  </a>
</figure>

There is also some work ongoing to have HTML rendering when browsing the API
using a Web browser. While still simple, we'd like to have a minimal Web
interface served on top of the API for the same price!

Ceilometer alarm subsystem supports Gnocchi with the Kilo release, meaning you
can use it to trigger actions when a metric value crosses some threshold. And
OpenStack [Heat](http://launchpad.net/heat) also supports auto-scaling your
instances based on Ceilometer+Gnocchi alarms.

And there are a few more API calls that I didn't talked about here, so don't
hesitate to take a peek at the
[full documentation](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/gnocchi/)!

# Towards Gnocchi 1.1!

Gnocchi is a different beast in the OpenStack community. It is under the
umbrella of the Ceilometer program, but it's one of the first projects that is
not part of the (old) integrated release. Therefore we decided to have a
release schedule not directly linked to the OpenStack and we'll do release more
often that the rest of the old OpenStack components – probably once every 2
months or the like.

What's coming next is a close integration with Ceilometer (e.g. moving the
dispatcher code from Gnocchi to Ceilometer) and probably more features as we
have more requests from our users. We are also exploring different backends
such as InfluxDB (storage) or MongoDB (indexer).

Stay tuned, and happy hacking!
