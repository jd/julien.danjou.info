Recent *Emacs* versions have a wonderful capacity to hide the mouse pointer as
soon as you type and insert characters in a buffer. This is controlled by
the *`make-pointer-invisible'* variable, which is set to t by default.

{% endmark %}

However that does not hide the pointer when simply moving the cursor on
screen. Therefore, I've started to use *`mouse-avoidance-mode'*, which make
the mouse pointer jump if your cursor hits it.

Unfortunately, if your cursor hits the invisible mouse pointer,
*`mouse-avoidance-mode'* makes it jump too, because it does not know it is
invisible.

Well, it *did* not know. Now it does, [thanks to my patches](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-10/msg00574.html)
which have been merged in Emacs 24. Using the new function
**frame-pointer-invisible-p**, one can know if the mouse pointer has been
hidden by Emacs. Therefore I enhanced `mouse-avoidance-mode' to use it, and
everything is alright now. :-)
