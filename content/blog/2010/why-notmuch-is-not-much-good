I've recently got a mail from one of my faithful reader, asking why not
considering [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/).

Actually, I think notmuch already exists in a better way, and that's called
[IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) and [Sieve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)).

What *notmuch* does, is tagging your mail with tags (obviously), based on
filtering rules you write. The big downside is that you have to tag all your
mails on your computer.

And if you use several computers, you'll have to tag several times your
mails. And you'll have to find a way to maintain your rules to be identical
on all your computers. That does not scale.

Using Sieve for mail filtering, one can do already that actually, and much
more.

A *notmuch* rule like:

<pre>
notmuch tag +intel from:intel.com and not tag:intel
</pre>

Can be written as a Sieve rule like:

<pre>
if address :all :contains "From" "intel.com" {
	addflag "intel";
}
</pre>

The flags extension for Sieve is explained in [RFC5232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5232).

The Sieve based solution has the advantage of being treated server side, and
therefore not subject to multiple or different MUA usages. It's also fast,
if you use a good IMAP server like [Dovecot](http://www.dovecot.org), which has indexing, etc.

Furthermore, Sieve can obviously do a lot more than tagging, like splitting
into different mailboxes, filtering with regexp usage, vacation, etc.

And if you want to fetch your mail locally, you can synchronize the IMAP box
entirely with any software able to (like [OfflineIMAP](http://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki)).

Now, what's probably missing, is a correct support for IMAP flags on various
MUA around. But that's not something *notmuch* helps to solve either. :-)
