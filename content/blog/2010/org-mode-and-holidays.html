{% mark excerpt %}

[Org-mode](http://orgmode.org) has a nice option which allows you to show
week-end days in a different color in your agenda. That means that Saturday
and Sunday (when I do not work) are fontified with *org-agenda-date-weekend*.

{% endmark %}

But there are other days I do not work, like my vacations or holidays.

Therefore, I've wrote a patch to add *`org-agenda-day-face-function'* which is
optionally called to determine what should be the face used to fontify a
day. [This](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-11/msg00542.html) allows me to use the same face for holidays and for week-end days, like for last Thursday which was an holiday in France.

That patch has been merged in Org last week.
