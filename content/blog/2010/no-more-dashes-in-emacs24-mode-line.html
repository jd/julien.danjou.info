We all know the good old Emacs mode-line you got under every window. Since
the beginning (a long time ago), it starts and ends with dashes. I've
proposed [a patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-10/msg00675.html)
to remove them.

After:

This has been merged in Emacs 24. You won't see any more ugly dashes in
graphical mode.
