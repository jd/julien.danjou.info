Last week, I spent some time implementing various color manipulation
routines. The ultimate goal was to find a way to determine if a text in
a certain color was readable on a background with a different color.

Something I failed to do so far, despite my research in the area.

However, since I think my code could be useful for other people, I've set up
a tiny [git repository](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=~jd/color-el.git;a=summary) with the routines I wrote.

The funniest one to implement was
[CIEDE2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000). I
verified my code with the data given in [the specifications](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~gsharma/ciede2000/ciede2000noteCRNA.pdf) and can assure it's correct. :-)
