In February 2009, my friend [dim](http://tapoueh.org) tried to force me using Emacs. I know a
couple of people using it and [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org) for reading their mail, and it always
made me curious.

At that time, more than a year ago, Emacs 22 and Gnus did not seem usable
from my point of view.

But around mid February, with the help of dim, I tried again to start using
Emacs.

Actually, this was not something new for me. I (very basically) used Emacs
between 2000 and 2006. In 2006, when I finished the university and started
working at [vim](http://www.easter-eggs.com][Easter-eggs]], I met a couple of [[http://www.vim.org) enthusiasts. They taught me
how to use it in various ways, and I started to know more about vim than
Emacs, so I switched.

This time, I started by configuring it, but reading the manual and also
learning a bit of Lisp. It took me several weeks, but step by step I learned
many, many things. And I must admit, I liked it.

I've configured and starting to use some very important mode, like Gnus,
[Org mode](http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][Muse]], the famous [[http://www.orgmode.org) or even ERC.

I'll probably talk about various Emacs related things in the near future,
since I already wrote more than a thousand lines of Lisp in the last 2
months.

Anyhow, I'd just conclude by asserting that my new Emacs/Gnus/Org/ERC setup
beats my old vim/mutt/nothing/irssi to the death with a baseball bat. :-)
