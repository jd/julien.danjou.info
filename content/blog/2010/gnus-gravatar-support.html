This last couple of days I've been dedicated making [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org)… fresher.

I've decided to give a whirl on [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com) support. I already tried the
*gravatar.el* lying on the Interweb, but well, it was crap: it used *wget* to
fetch pictures, therefore was totally synchronous. Reading each mail was
slower. The cache did not even have TTL, as far as I recall.

So, I've now wrote **[gravatar.el](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/tree/lisp/gravatar.el)** implementing the Gravatar API. Asynchronously
of course. With cache, TTL, etc. Perfect. :-)

Then I've composed **[gnus-gravatar.el](http://git.gnus.org/cgit/gnus.git/tree/lisp/gnus-gravatar.el)**, implementing a washing function adding
Gravatar for *From* field and/or *Cc/To* fields, like done for [picons](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/picons/).

As I was expecting, the patch was badly received by the GNU guys, which
start talking about thinks like external resources, privacy, non-free
software, etc. Boring.

Fortunately, Lars allowed me to push the patch in git so everybody can give
it a try. I'm now waiting for feedbacks in order to know if I will have to
maintain this patch outside Gnus, or not.

Here's the mandatory screen-shot.
