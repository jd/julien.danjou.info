        Python is a wonderful programming language that allows to write
        applications quickly. But how do you make those applications scale for
        thousands of users and requests?

        It takes years of practice, research, trial and errors to build
        experience and knowledge along the way. Simple questions such as "How
        do I make my code faster?" or "How do I make sure there is no
        bottleneck?" cost hours to find good answers. Without enough background
        on the topic, you'll never be sure that any answer you'll come up with
        will be correct.

        The Hacker's Guide to Scaling Python will help you solve that by
        providing guidelines, tips and best practice. Adding a few interviews
        of experts on the subject, you will learn how you can distribute your
        Python application so it is able to process thousands of requests.

        Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and
        more. It is fast, flexible, and comes with batteries included.

        Most of the books you read about Python teach you the language basics.
        In this book, I want to show you how to leverage Python to efficiently
        tackle your problems and build great Python applications.
